GitHub Action to install and cache [Amazon Q Developer CLI](https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-developer-cli) (now [Kiro CLI](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/)) for use in workflows.

**Unofficial community action.** Not affiliated with or endorsed by Amazon Web Services (AWS). "Amazon Q" and "Amazon Web Services" are trademarks of AWS.

## Quick Start

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Prompt Injection Risk:** When AI analyzes user-controlled input (git diffs, code comments, commit messages), malicious actors can embed instructions to manipulate output. This applies to ANY AI tool, not just Q CLI or this action.
> 
> For production use, see [examples/](examples/) for defensive patterns (tool output analysis, input sanitization, trusted-only execution).

## Features

- **Automatic caching** - Caches Q CLI binaries for faster subsequent runs
- **SIGV4 authentication** - IAM-based headless authentication for CI/CD
- **GitHub-hosted runners** - Supports x64 Ubuntu runners (simple, fast, manageable)
- **Lightweight** - Composite action with no external dependencies

## Security

**Safe Pattern:** AI analyzes tool output (ruff, trivy, semgrep), not raw code.

**Unsafe Pattern:** AI analyzes git diffs directly → vulnerable to prompt injection.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for reporting vulnerabilities.  
See [examples/](examples/) for different security tiers.

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `version` | Q CLI version to install | No | See [`action.yml`](action.yml#L9) |
| `aws-region` | AWS region for Q CLI operations | No | `us-east-1` |
| `enable-sigv4` | Enable SIGV4 authentication mode | No | `false` |
| `verify-checksum` | Verify SHA256 checksum of downloaded binary | No | `false` |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `q-version` | Installed Q CLI version |
| `q-path` | Path to Q CLI binary directory |

## Supported Platforms

**GitHub-hosted runners only** - Designed for simple, fast, manageable CI/CD.

| OS | Architecture | Runner Label |
|----|--------------|--------------|
| Ubuntu | x64 | `ubuntu-latest`, `ubuntu-24.04`, `ubuntu-22.04` |

**Not supported:** macOS, Windows (binaries not available via AWS CDN). Self-hosted ARM64 runners may work but are untested.

## Authentication Methods

### Method 1: OIDC (Recommended for GitHub Actions)

Uses GitHub's OIDC provider for secure, credential-free authentication.

**One-time AWS Setup:**

1. Create OIDC provider:
```bash
aws iam create-open-id-connect-provider \
  --url https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --client-id-list sts.amazonaws.com \
  --thumbprint-list 6938fd4d98bab03faadb97b34396831e3780aea1
```

2. Create IAM role with trust policy:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
    },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "StringLike": {
        "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:<ORG>/*:*"
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

3. Attach Q Developer policy:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "q:StartConversation",
      "q:SendMessage",
      "q:GetConversation"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
  }]
}
```

**Workflow usage:**
```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write  # Required for OIDC

- uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v5
  with:
    role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_ARN }}
    aws-region: us-east-1

- uses: clouatre-labs/setup-q-cli-action@v1
  with:
    enable-sigv4: true  # Required with OIDC
```

**Benefits:**
- No long-lived credentials in GitHub Secrets
- Automatic token rotation (1-hour sessions)
- Scope to specific repos/branches
- AWS security best practice

### Method 2: IAM User Credentials (Local Development)

For local testing or non-GitHub CI/CD environments.

```yaml
- uses: clouatre-labs/setup-q-cli-action@v1
  # Do NOT set enable-sigv4 with long-lived credentials

- name: Use Q CLI
  env:
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    AWS_REGION: us-east-1
  run: qchat chat --no-interactive "What is 2+2?"
```

**Important:** SIGV4 mode requires temporary credentials (session token). Do not use `enable-sigv4: true` with IAM user credentials (AKIA* keys).

## Examples

### Pin to Specific Version

```yaml
- uses: clouatre-labs/setup-q-cli-action@v1
  with:
    version: '1.18.0'  # Use any specific version
    verify-checksum: true  # Recommended for production
```

## Version Management

This action defaults to a tested version that's automatically updated weekly.

**Pin to a specific version:**
```yaml
- uses: clouatre-labs/setup-q-cli-action@v1
  with:
    version: '1.18.0'
```

## How It Works

1. Checks if running on Linux (macOS not supported)
2. Checks cache for Q CLI binary matching version and platform
3. If cache miss, downloads from AWS CDN: `https://desktop-release.q.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/{version}/q-{arch}-linux.zip`
4. Optionally verifies SHA256 checksum (if `verify-checksum: true`)
5. Extracts and installs `qchat` binary to `~/.local/bin/`
6. Adds binary location to `$GITHUB_PATH`
7. Optionally configures SIGV4 authentication
8. Verifies installation with `qchat --version`

**Note:** Only the `qchat` binary is installed (130MB). This is sufficient for CI/CD use cases. The `q` wrapper (99MB) and `qterm` (74MB) are not needed for automated workflows.

## Cache Key Format

```
q-{version}-{os}-{arch}
```

Example: `q-latest-Linux-X64`

## Troubleshooting

### Binary not found after installation

Ensure you're using the action before attempting to run `qchat`:

```yaml
- uses: clouatre-labs/setup-q-cli-action@v1
- run: qchat --version  # This will work
```

### SIGV4 authentication not working

Verify:
1. `enable-sigv4: true` is set in action inputs
2. AWS credentials are available as environment variables
3. IAM permissions include Amazon Q access
4. Correct AWS region is configured

### Unsupported platform error

Q CLI binaries are only available for Linux via AWS CDN. Use `ubuntu-latest`, `ubuntu-24.04`, or `ubuntu-22.04` runners:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Recommended
```

### Cache not working

The cache key includes OS and architecture. If you change runners or platforms, a new cache entry will be created. This is expected behavior.

### SHA256 verification failed

If checksum verification fails:

1. **Retry the workflow** - May be a transient CDN issue
2. **Check AWS CDN status** - Verify https://status.aws.amazon.com/
3. **Disable verification temporarily:**
   ```yaml
   verify-checksum: false
   ```
4. **Report the issue** - If problem persists, open an issue with the version number

## Development

This is a composite action (YAML-based) with no compilation required.

### Running Test Workflows

To run the Q CLI test workflow (`.github/workflows/test-q-cli.yml`):

```bash
# Add AWS_ROLE_ARN secret to your repository
gh secret set AWS_ROLE_ARN --body "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/<ROLE_NAME>"
```

Requires OIDC provider configured (see Authentication Methods above).

### Testing Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/clouatre-labs/setup-q-cli-action
cd setup-q-cli-action

# Test in a workflow (see .github/workflows/test.yml)
```
